```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Load the three data sets that we are going to join, surveys.csv, species.csv, plots.csv:

```{r}
surveys <- read.csv(file = "../data-raw/surveys.csv")
species <- read.csv(file = "../data-raw/species.csv")
plots <- read.csv(file = "../data-raw/plots.csv")
```

## Problem 3
Create a data frame 
with the average "hindfoot_length"  - I should use the mean function and apply it to hindfoot length
for each "species_id" in each "year" - to solve this. I would gorup by species id and then by year
with no null values - remove NA from hindfoot length

```{r}
surveys %>% 
  filter(!is.na(hindfoot_length)) %>% 
  group_by(species_id, year) %>% 
  summarize(mean(hindfoot_length, na.rm = TRUE)) # filtering is more efficient than calling the argument na.rm
```

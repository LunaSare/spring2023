James' Waterford plan

1. Plan: Do background research to decide if you have enough resources and information to begin collecting data.
1. Collection: Collect data from the sources you found in your plan.
1. Process: Raw data needs to be cut down and prepared via a coding program.
1. Analyze: Usually I will have some preliminary results. At this point, I have someone double check  the conclusions that my data suggests.
1. Visualize: Refine your results with clear, comprehensible graphs. 
1. Publish: Store and share my results.

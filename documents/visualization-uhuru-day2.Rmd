## Read raw ndata in

We are working with the file `ACACIA_DREPANOLOBIUM_SURVEY.txt` file that currently lives in the `data-raw` folder.

```{r eval=TRUE}
#make sure to provide file name as relative path
read.csv(file = "../data-raw/ACACIA_DREPANOLOBIUM_SURVEY.txt",
         sep = "\t",
         na.strings = "dead") -> acacia
```

```{r}
head(acacia)
```
## Plot the data as a scatterplot

For this we use the function `geom_point()`

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = acacia, mapping = aes(x = HEIGHT, y = FRUITS, color = ANT)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~ANT)
```

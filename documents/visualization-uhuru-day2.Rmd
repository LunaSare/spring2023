```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Read raw data in

<!--
whatever I do not want rendered
-->
```{r echo = FALSE}
# some words for myself
```

We are working with the file `ACACIA_DREPANOLOBIUM_SURVEY.txt` file that currently lives in the `data-raw` folder.

```{r eval=TRUE}
# make sure to provide file name as relative path
read.csv(file = "../data-raw/ACACIA_DREPANOLOBIUM_SURVEY.txt",
         sep = "\t",
         na.strings = "dead") -> acacia
```

```{r}
head(acacia)
```
## Plot the data as a scatterplot

For this we use the function `geom_point()`

```{r}
ggplot(data = acacia, mapping = aes(x = HEIGHT, y = FRUITS, color = ANT)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~ANT)
```
### Exercise 1.

Create a scatterplot of circumference vs height
```{r}

```

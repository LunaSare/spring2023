# Intro to version control

## Why version control systems?
- Efficient way of keeping track of changes in a document
- keep track of changes in any type sof document: txt, table, images

## Conflicts in version control
- Conflict happens when someone changes the same part of a document at the same time

## What is a commit 
- saves the changes made to files to a repository
- it does not have to be all files at a time

## What is a repository?
- it is the whole of files and file versions, along with the history of changes made (commits)

## Differnece between old and modern version control systems
- centralization vs distribution

# Setting up git

## Creating branches

```
hint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch. This default branch name
hint: is subject to change. To configure the initial branch name to use in all
hint: of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:
hint: 
hint:         git config --global init.defaultBranch <name>
hint: 
hint: Names commonly chosen instead of 'master' are 'main', 'trunk' and
hint: 'development'. The just-created branch can be renamed via this command:
hint: 
hint:         git branch -m <name>
```
